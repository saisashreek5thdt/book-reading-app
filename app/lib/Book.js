    content: `Ten year old Veer is a very intelligent and curious boy. He and his Dadaji are great friends. They sleep in the same room. At bedtime before falling asleep, Dadaji makes up interesting stories on any topic that he feels little Veer should be aware of.
              Veer's school was soon to hold a workshop on Space. Veer wanted to actively participate in this workshop. He was very intrested in learning about India's Space Research Programme.
              The topic constantly played on his mind. one night, after completing his homework, packing his bag for school, and getting his uniform ready, Veer jumped into bed and snuggled against Dadaji.
              Veer - Dadaji, tell me a story about space, the moon, and astronauts.
              Dadaji's eyes twinkle. He had been expecting this question from Veer for quite some time now. He knew about the fourthcoming workshop in the boy's school, and had seen his excited preparations.
              Dadaji - What is so special about the moon today?
              veer - Dadaji, this morning while cleaning my room, I saw the picture of a spacecraft on the moon on the front page of a newspaper. There were also picture of people celebrating. I want to know why this news was so important that day.
              Dadaji - Veer, it was a very great day in the history of Space research, as well as for India. Modiji has rightly named  23 August as National Space Day. But first let me tell you a small story about the moon which I heard from my grandmother when I was young.
              Veer - Wow! Tell me quickly, Dadaji.
              Dadaji Once upon a time, a young princess wanted to go to the moon. The king didn't know how to fulfill his daughter's foolish wish. He promised a huge reward for anyone who would please his daughter. Many courtiers came forward with various ideas but none could please the princess.
              One day, a saint came and took the challenge. He asked the king to bring his daughter before him.
               Saint - Tell me, little one, how big is the moon?Princess It is as wide as my index finger.
When I lift it towards the moon, it completely covers it, and then I can't see the moon at all.
Saint Do you know how high it is?
Princess - It's visible just above that tree in the palace garden.
I think it is just as high as that tree.
Saint What does the moon look like?
Princess - It is white and bright like silver. Veer - Wow! I can't wait to know more. Tell me all, Dadaji. All the news channels too were very proudly broadcasting India's moonlanding, and everyone was so happy. Why was it such a big news? After all, hasn't`,

//     content: `Atomic Habits is a powerful book that draws on scientific research and real-life examples to explain how small changes can lead to remarkable results.
// CHAPTER 1: THE SURPRISING POWER OF ATOMIC HABITS
// The aggregation of marginal gains is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. This approach suggests that if you break down a goal into the smallest parts and then improve on each part by just 1 percent, you'll experience significant improvement when those small gains compound.
// The power of habits lies in their ability to compound over time. Small behaviors, repeated consistently, can lead to dramatic changes. However, the immediate impact of any single instance is often invisible.
// Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.
// CHAPTER 2: HOW YOUR HABITS SHAPE YOUR IDENTITY
// Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
// Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
// The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
// To change your habits, you need to change your beliefs about yourself. You need to cultivate a new identity by proving to yourself with small wins that you are indeed capable of change.`,

// To observe your mind in automatic mode, glance at the image of a woman shown at the top of this page. Your mind automatically constructs a story about this woman: how old she is, what emotions she is expressing, where she might be looking.
// This automatic mental work, including the construction of the story, is called System 1. It refers to thinking that operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
// System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
// CHAPTER 2: ATTENTION AND EFFORT
// Look at the image at the top of this page. Try solving a multiplication problem like 17 × 24. Now you experienced a surge of conscious attention. This is System 2 working hard.
// System 2 requires attention and effort; if that attention is disrupted, your performance will suffer. The intense focusing on one task makes people effectively blind to stimuli that normally attract attention.
// People who are cognitively busy are more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations.`,

// About 13.5 billion years ago, matter, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics.
// About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry.
// About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology.
// About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is called history.
// CHAPTER 2: THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE
// The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. The most important cognitive revolution was the development of language.

// I wrote this book to convince you that soft skills are more important than the technical side of money. I'll do this in a way that's approachable to everyone, and no more complicated than it needs to be.
// In investing, the average is what you'll get if you hold an index fund that owns every stock in America. One percent of investors have beaten the S&P 500 Index by at least two percentage points per year over a decade.
// Financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.
// CHAPTER 1: NO ONE'S CRAZY
// Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.
// Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And what you've experienced is more compelling than what you learn second-hand. So all of us—you, me, everyone—go through life anchored to a set of views about how money works that vary wildly from person to person. What seems crazy to you might make sense to me.
// Money has been around a long time. King Alyattes of Lydia, now part of Turkey, is thought to have created the first official currency in 600 BC. His coins were minted with pictures, marking the denomination of the currency with the image of a fox, lion, or goat.
// But technology, medicine, and communications have evolved at a speed that money has not.
// CHAPTER 2: LUCK & RISK
// Financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer.
// But that's rich, white-collar America. What about the more common example of a factory worker, the epitome of the post-war American Dream?
// My father-in-law grew up on a farm and came to the United States in his early 20s with little education, few skills, and not much money. Manual labor was his only option. He got a job at a Ford factory in Virginia.`,
